This is an Eclipse project. There are 2 packages under CeilingFanApp/src:

_hsn.fan_ and _hsn.fan.noenum_

The difference is that package hsn.fan uses enum while package hsn.fan.noenum does not use enum

Each package contains two classes and another for Unit Test

_FanController_ has two methods _pullSpeedCord()_ and _pullDirectionCord()_ that control _CeilingFan_ Speed and Direction

_FanControllerTest_ contains 6 methods for test cases
